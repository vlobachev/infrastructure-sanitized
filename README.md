# Infrastructure Files

This repository is used to store and share various files related to the creation of my home network infrastructure.  Primarily, it will consist of various docker files (docker-compose or Dockerfile files) as well and any scripts (bash or powershell) which I find useful in maintaining my infrastructure.
